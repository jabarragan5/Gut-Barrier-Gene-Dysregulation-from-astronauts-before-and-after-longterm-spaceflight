This analysis explores the expression of 115 gut-barrier genes using cfRNA data collected from astronauts
before and after long-term spaceflight. The dataset includes fold changes and p-values comparing baseline
samples on Earth to samples taken after more than 100 days aboard the International Space Station. The
purpose of this analysis is to visualize which genes are significantly up- or down-regulated and to highlight
those that may indicate compromised gut barrier integrity, a condition known as “leaky gut”.
